## Requirements
The running environment for Deep Forest and ADAPT needs to be installed.<br>
Please refer to the following website for the installation steps.<br>
https://deep-forest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation_guide.html <br>
https://adapt-python.github.io/adapt/install.html <br>

Note:<br>
(1)The method proposed in this study is an improvement based on Deep Forest framework.<br>
(2)ADAPT is a Python package providing some well known domain adaptation methods.<br>
(3)Sometimes, the installation environments of Deep Forest and ADAPT may cause conflicts, depending on the software upgrades of the corresponding communities. It is possible to consider calculate the distance relationship among toxicity endpoints in ADAPT environment in advance, and then implement the proposed method in Deep Forest environment.

## Code Description
(1)"CFFAT_5FoldCV.py" demonstrates the training and testing process of conducting a 5-fold cross-validation on 59 toxicity endpoints.<br>
(2)"CFFAT_5FoldCV_Result_Demo.log" presents the detailed running results of the code.
